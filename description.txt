Ancients Awakened Challengers:
Do you want to have a fight with the ancients with real power?
If you want to challenge yourself or want to experience the real power of ancients, try this mod.
The power of the Ancients in this mod is based on the original design.

You must be familiar with each weapons in AAMod, which could help you with choosing the best weapons.

However it is a fanmade mod which fixes the bugs and adjusts the boss difficulty, which doesn't have any relationships to the new AA's progress.

Changes in 1.0.0.2:

1.Fix the problem FA and ZP jumping on player's face.

2.Fix the unclearly ZP bullet

3.Buff the YamataA and AkumaA.

4.Buff the Athena and GreedA.

5.Buff the CRajah.

6.Nerf the ShenA.

7.Add some accessories for the Challengers.

WARNING: This mod will seriously affect your normal playthrough. If some bosses are too powerful for you to defeat, this is very much the norm. That's why we nerf them. Maybe you can try your best and figure out how to defeat them.

Thanks for all these people working for this mod:
